# decision log

## purpose

Preserve a durable owner-confirmed choice and its reason so future sessions build on it instead of reopening it without new evidence.

## trigger

The owner asks to record a confirmed choice, or an explicitly triggered wrap requires the decision to be logged.

## steps

1. Confirm both authorization and durability. Exploration, mood, and agent recommendations do not qualify.
2. Choose one owner: a business or project decision file when the decision belongs there; otherwise `life/records/decisions.md`.
3. Match the existing format and append a dated entry with Decision, Why, and an optional Revisit condition.
4. Name what it supersedes when relevant.
5. List downstream files the decision may require; do not silently expand scope.
6. Tell the owner exactly what was recorded.

## boundaries

- Never log an unconfirmed agent opinion as the owner's decision.
- A decision reached during read-only discussion is not itself permission to modify a log; ask once whether to record it.
- Decision records are append-only; newer entries supersede older ones.
- Summarize sensitive details and reference their private source.
